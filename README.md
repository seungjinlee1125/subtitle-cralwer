# Subtitle-Crawler

## Oveview

* While I have been studying English in U.S. nowadays, I realized that some needs for looking into some example sentences, which are spoken by real natives. However, whenever I try to find it, I always find it difficult to be convinced. Therefore, I've been thinking about **the English studying support program** which finds subtitle files with various extensions and save them to the database and shows requested result with the contexts.

* Since I've never experienced general development project with databases, it would be the great chance for me to start Web Development. I expect that I would be able to work with several web frameworks, libraries, version control tools and cloud services like AWS, Azure.

* Doing some sub-project for learning the tools that I need to implement this project.

  


## Steps in the project

##### 1. Implementing WEB server 

Implement server on AWS ubuntu EC2 with node.js, express.js, MYSQL/MongoDB

***Sub-Project*** 

Implementing server which collects data such as temperature, humidity from IoT connected sensor using ESP8266, ESP32 or Arduino with Wifi Shield...

##### 2. Crawling subtitle files and process, save it to databases

* Crawling subtitle files from some free website like https://subscene.com/, http://www.yifysubtitles.com/
* Try using API to collect data if it's provided.
* (Finding some examples for crawling)

##### 3. Implementing Searchine using Elastic Search
